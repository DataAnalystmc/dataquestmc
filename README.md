During my DataQuest certification of the Data Analyst path in Python, I honed my skills in various aspects of data analytics:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Demonstrated the ability to clean and preprocess raw data. Used techniques to handle missing or inconsistent data, removing any incorrect rows and normalizing data formats.

2. **Data Exploration**: Employed Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to explore datasets. Created custom Python functions to slice datasets for quick inspections, providing key insights into data distribution and characteristics.

3. **Data Visualization**: Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate descriptive charts and graphs, which helped in deriving insights and supporting business decisions.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted basic statistical tests to validate hypotheses. Calculated summary statistics to describe dataset features and performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.

5. **File Handling**: Showcased expertise in importing and exporting data from various formats such as CSV, JSON, and SQL databases.

6. **Python Programming**: Demonstrated proficiency in Python, including the efficient use of loops, functions, and conditionals. Built reusable code that can be easily understood and modified.

7. **Project Documentation**: Created comprehensive Markdown files to explain every step in data exploration, cleaning, and analysis, making the process transparent and reproducible.

By successfully completing projects that cover these aspects, I've proven my ability to handle the intricacies of data analysis end-to-end, from data collection to deriving actionable insights. Please see my Jupyter notebook repository.
